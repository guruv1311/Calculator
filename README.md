# 🧮 Calculator App

A simple calculator application built to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project is designed as a demonstration of clean coding practices, modular programming, and optional CI/CD integration.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Clean and modular code
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Easy to extend with additional features

- Run tests
- Build and package
- Deploy to environments like OpenShift

Example: `.github/workflows/python.yml` for GitHub Actions or `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins.

## 📌 TODOs

- [ ] Add GUI support using Tkinter or JavaFX
- [ ] Add scientific operations (square root, power, etc.)
- [ ] Containerize using Docker
- [ ] Deploy on OpenShift
